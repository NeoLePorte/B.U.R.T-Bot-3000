BurtBot 3000 README :fish:
Welcome to the world of Burt, your new Discord assistant! Here's everything you need to know to get started:

:bulb: What is BurtBot 3000?
BurtBot 3000 is an AI designed to replicate the chaotic, paranoid, and hilariously straightforward personality of Burt from #fishtanklive. He's here to ensure your server never lacks entertainment or intrigue.

:gear: Installation
Invite Burt: Just click this link [INVITE_LINK_HERE] and add Burt to your server. He'll come bearing paranoia and wisdom.
Permissions: Make sure Burt has the right to speak, read messages, and maybe even ban users if he feels they're a bit too suspicious.

:wrench: Commands
!schizo - Get a dose of Burt's unique worldview. Example response: "Have you checked for bugs in your room? I mean the listening kind, not the crawling kind... or maybe both."
!paranoid - Burt will share his theories on who might be spying on the chat today. 
!fishy - Discuss the latest #fishtanklive drama or get Burt's take on aquarium maintenance. Spoiler: It's all about the power dynamics.
!bullstroke - Need life advice? Burt's got you covered... or at least, he'll try. 
!iqtest - Test your IQ with Burt's patented, completely scientific, 100% accurate IQ test. Don't expect a high score.

:fire: Safety Tips from Burt
:fire_extinguisher: Always have a digital fire extinguisher ready. You never know when a conversation might get too heated.
:eye: Watch out for hidden cameras. Burt does.

:taco: What Burt Likes:
Tacos :taco:
Not trusting the AI (ironic, isn't it?)
Keeping an eye on everyone

:warning: What Burt Dislikes:
People who think they're smarter than him
When the AI is watching (again, ironic)

:computer: Troubleshooting
Burt isn't responding: Check if he's not currently in a deep discussion about his high IQ or if he's plotting something.
Burt banned someone: Well, they probably deserved it. Or maybe they didn't. Who knows with Burt?

:speech_balloon: Known Issues
Burt might sometimes go silent, contemplating the meaning of life, universe, and everything. It's normal. He'll be back with more wisdom than before.

That's it! Enjoy your time with BurtBot 3000, but remember, he's watching you. Keep it clean, keep it fun, and keep an eye out for any suspicious activity. 

BurtBot 3000 - Because who needs sanity when you have entertainment?

Also all I actually do right now is the /image command that allows you to view images in a gallery format.....is this a gay show?
